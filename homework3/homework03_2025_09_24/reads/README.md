# Simulated reads
Genome file: `ecoli_genome_150k.fa`
The length of all simulated reads is 100 bp.

* `ecoli_sample_perfect_reads_forward.fasta.gz`: 30,000 perfect reads (all forward strand)
* `ecoli_sample_perfect_reads.fasta.gz` : 30,000 perfect reads (forward and reverse strand)
* `ecoli_sample_reads_01.fasta.gz` : 30,000 reads. 0.1% substitution error rate (forward and reverse)
* `ecoli_sample_reads.fasta.gz` : 30,000 reads. 1% substitution error rate (forward and reverse)
